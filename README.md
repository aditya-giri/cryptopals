# cryptopals
My solutions to the Matasano Challenges in Cryptography.

I intend for this to primarily be a platform for learning crypto, but also a good way to pick up new languages.  
I want to solve these in Python at first and later in Haskell, x86 Assembly and whatever else I want to learn.

Note: The comments you see in the python files will have leading characters like `!`, `*`, or `?`. This is because I use the VSCode Extension `Better Comments` (aaron-bond.better-comments). It makes comments colorful and a lot easier to read.
